The town is actively visited by travelers from all around the world, so it is here where they have the chance to connect with people from very different places while retaining the unique aspects of a small community scene. The music is also something different, driven by poetic lyrics written in Spanish, groovy tunes that strive to get outside the harmonic commonplace, the presence of analogue synthesizers and electronic textures leading them away from the typical surfer-town local band, all these qualities resting placidly on their 4-piece Vocal Harmonies, and the uniqueness of the change in the band’s sound when bass and guitar are alternatively swapped around by the two main singers. The members of pug are: Nicolás Velez, on drums and vocals. Santiago Gavioli on Keys, Synths and Vocals, Valentin Gonzales and Gabriel Domeneghini on Guitar/Bass and Vocals. All of PUG's members produce, record, and write their music, taking active parts of the creative process. At this moment PUG is finishing the recording process of their first full-length Album, alternating local gigs with regional tours to perform in neighboring states.
